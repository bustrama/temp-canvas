/**
 * Palm rejection for finger navigation (ported from draw-a-chart). Once a pen has been seen,
 * fingers never draw, so a palm can at worst move the canvas; this policy stops that.
 * Deterministic and clock-injected for tests.
 *
 * 1. While the pen touches the screen, every new touch is a palm.
 * 2. Touches starting shortly after the pen lifted, or while the pen hovers (Apple Pencil hover,
 *    S Pen Air View), are palms: the hand is still resting / about to rest.
 * 3. Contacts reporting a large contact size are palms (only where the platform reports it).
 * 4. New touches close to a resting (rejected) contact are palms too; far away ones are allowed
 *    (e.g. the other hand panning while the writing hand rests).
 * 5. A touch gesture that started shortly before the pen landed is rolled back (the palm usually
 *    lands a moment before the nib).
 * Rejected touches stay rejected until they lift.
